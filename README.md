<br>
<p>Sometimes when we want to listen to some music we don't know what kind of music we want to listen. Whenever I listen to some music I am very curious about knowing how music recommendation works. This curiosity leads us to the idea to build a web platform that recommends music by asking a few questions which help to determine the personality of a person.</p>

<h1>How we built it🏆🎶✨ </h1>
We have used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the frontend. To handle the backend we have used Flask (Python web framework). We have used Spotify API to get the list of songs based on genres. We predict the genres of a song by knowing the personality of a user. After knowing the genres we pass that as a parameter in Spotify API which returns the list of recommended songs. We have researched and read some blogs to know how can personality of a user can help us to recommend a song. We have researched how we can find the personality of a person by asking proper questions. Apart from tech, we have also understood that what kind of music is recommended to a particular type of user based on his/her/their personality.
